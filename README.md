# These tell people using the repro how it should be used

# There are a few things you should include in a README
  - Description of the repo project
  - Contact info for you/the point person on the repo
  - A description of the usage terms (LICENCE) (CC; collective commons)
  - A detailed description of how to use the repo
  - A DOI/release number for your repo (separate from resulting paper)
